/**
 * Returns an ordered list of chats. Chats are sorted by the pair (order, chat_id) in
 * decreasing order. (For example, to get a list of chats from the beginning, the offset_order
 * should be equal to a biggest signed 64-bit number 9223372036854775807 == 2^63 - 1).
 * For optimal performance the number of returned chats is chosen by the library.
 * @param {Object} params
 * @param {number | string} [params.offsetOrder] - Chat order to return chats from
 * @param {number} [params.offsetChatId] - Chat identifier to return chats from
 * @param {number} [params.limit] - The maximum number of chats to be returned. It
 * is possible that fewer chats than the limit are returned even if the end of the list
 * is not reached
 * @param {Object} state
 * @returns {ChatsUnion}
